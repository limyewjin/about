It’s like how we have 100x more powerful machines and storage, yet our calculator apps have bloated to use 99x of that improvement.</p>

<p>In 2013, anthropologist David Graeber coined the term ‘bullshit jobs’ - roles so meaningless that even those doing them struggle to justify their existence. Fast forward to 2024, and AI is poised to automate many of these jobs.</p>

<p>As AI threatens to displace 300 million full-time jobs globally, we’re at a crossroads. Could AI finally deliver on Keynes’ vision by eliminating ‘bullshit jobs’? Or will it simply create new forms of meaningless work, like ‘AI babysitters’?</p>

<p>I’m a tech optimist, but an incentive pessimist. People make money doing jobs, even if they’re meaningless. So I predict a Cambrian explosion of bullshit AI jobs.

The journey from early game-playing algorithms to today’s multifaceted AI systems is nothing short of extraordinary.</p>

<h3 id="the-game-changing-progression">The Game-Changing Progression</h3>

<p>The evolution of game AI tells a fascinating story of human ingenuity. We started with simple minimax algorithms and alpha-beta pruning, techniques that seemed cutting-edge at the time. Then came knowledge-based systems, leveraging human expertise to improve performance.</p>

<p>A significant leap during my PhD was the advent of Monte Carlo methods, particularly Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This probabilistic approach opened new horizons, allowing AI to handle the vast complexity of games like Go.</p>

<p>In fact, the impact of MCTS on the field was so profound that it accelerated my own academic journey. I was deep into my PhD research on forward pruning and selective search in game-tree search when MCTS emerged. It quickly became clear that complete game-tree search might not be the future of game AI. This realization prompted me to swiftly wrap up my research into a PhD thesis.
The last paragraph of my <a href="https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/13327">thesis</a> (2007) reflects this pivotal moment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The game of Go can be considered as the grand challenge of game AI at this point in time. One interesting development in computer Go has been the introduction of Monte Carlo methods that combine game-tree search and randomly generated moves for evaluation [Coulom, 2006, Kocsis and Szepesvári, 2006]. The random nature of Monte Carlo methods corresponds well with the theoretical analysis of the properties of forward pruning presented in this thesis, and should extend to Monte Carlo tree search. More research on how to incorporate risk management strategies in forward pruning can be done to further improve the state of the art for Monte Carlo tree search.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looking back, it’s remarkable how accurate this assessment was. MCTS indeed became a cornerstone in advanced game AI, particularly in conquering the game of Go.</p>

<p>But the true revolution came with the integration of deep learning. Neural networks, once considered a relic of AI’s past, roared back to life. They brought with them the ability to learn complex patterns and strategies from raw data. This culminated in the creation of AlphaGo, a system that shocked the world by defeating Lee Saedol, one of the greatest Go players of our time.</p>

<p>Yet, AlphaGo was just the beginning. AlphaGo Zero and then AlphaZero demonstrated that AI could learn superhuman strategies without any human knowledge, purely through self-play. The implications were staggering.</p>

<h3 id="beyond-the-game-board">Beyond the Game Board</h3>

<p>What truly excites me is how these game-playing techniques have found applications far beyond the world of board games. Let me share some cutting-edge examples:</p>

<h4 id="weather-forecasting">Weather Forecasting</h4>

<p>The advancements in game AI have found significant applications beyond the game board, one of which is weather forecasting. Google’s MetNet-3<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> leverages techniques reminiscent of those used in game AI to tackle the complexities of atmospheric dynamics. By integrating the data assimilation and simulation processes into a single neural network pass, MetNet-3 can provide high-resolution weather predictions up to 24 hours ahead, covering variables such as precipitation, temperature, wind, and dew point. This model outperforms traditional physics-based numerical weather prediction methods, achieving temporal resolutions as fine as two minutes and spatial resolutions of one to four kilometers.</p>

<h4 id="drug-discovery">Drug Discovery</h4>

<p>In the realm of drug discovery, AI techniques refined in game-playing applications are accelerating research and development. Insilico Medicine’s AI-generated drug for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> is a prime example. Their AI system, which includes platforms like PandaOmics and Chemistry42, identified a novel therapeutic target (TNIK) and designed a small molecule (INS018_055) for IPF treatment in just 18 months, a process that traditionally takes years. This AI-driven approach mirrors game AI’s method of identifying key strategic points and developing optimal strategies to exploit them. The rapid progression of this AI-designed drug, now in Phase 2 clinical trials, underscores the potential of AI in pharmaceutical research.</p>

<h4 id="molecular-biology">Molecular Biology</h4>

<p>In molecular biology, the impact of AI is profoundly illustrated by AlphaFold 3<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, which extends the capabilities of its predecessor by predicting the structure and interactions of a wide range of biological molecules, including proteins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules. This progression from predicting protein structures to modeling complex molecular interactions showcases the significant leap in AI’s application in biology. AlphaFold 3’s enhanced architecture, featuring an improved Evoformer module and a diffusion network, has achieved a substantial improvement in the accuracy of predicting protein interactions, further advancing our understanding of cellular biology.</p>

<h3 id="the-common-thread">The Common Thread</h3>

<p>What fascinates me most is the common thread running through all these applications – the ability of AI to learn complex patterns and make decisions in high-dimensional, uncertain environments. Whether it’s navigating the vast possibility space of Go, predicting chaotic weather systems, or exploring the intricate world of molecular structures, AI is proving to be a powerful tool.</p>

<h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h3>

<p>As we stand at this exciting juncture, I can’t help but wonder: what’s next? Which field will see the next AlphaZero-like breakthrough? How might these AI techniques reshape your industry?</p>

<p>One thing is certain – we’re not just spectators in this AI renaissance. We’re potential collaborators, innovators, and pioneers. The games AI has learned to play have prepared it for the greatest game of all – advancing human knowledge and capabilities across all fields of endeavor.</p>

<p>I’m eager to hear your thoughts. How do you see AI impacting your field in the coming years?</p>

<p>Basically, no matter how you slice and dice your projects to optimize for Growth (capital G), the real growth (lowercase g) often lies in the seams between those projects and teams.</p>

<p>Picture this: a widget company has a deals team that busts their posteriors to secure awesome Black Friday discounts. They even get those deals featured on the homepage. Sounds great, right? All those users flooding the site will see the deals and go wild!</p>

<p>But wait, what about the email and notifications team? Shouldn’t they be crafting personalized updates and maybe even more exclusive deals for engaged users? And what about marketing? Are they on the same page with messaging, or will users get confused by mixed signals?</p>

<p>In big companies, this kind of coordination doesn’t happen automagically. Teams often optimize for their own little fiefdoms without seeing the bigger picture.</p>

<p>Now, decentralizing growth efforts is usually the secret to scaling. Trying to centralize everything just creates org friction and slows things down.</p>

<p>But there are times when it’s worth the extra elbow grease to get everyone singing from the same hymnal. My rule of thumb? When there’s a tidal wave of users expected, like during Black Friday or the World Cup, it’s time to yell (figuratively!) and get all hands on deck.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, growth is a team sport. By breaking down silos and looking at the big picture, you can find those hidden gems that really move the needle.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doing growth is like finding coins between the couch cushions]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">For growth’s sake, don’t be dogmatic</title><link href="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/do-not-dogmatic/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="For growth’s sake, don’t be dogmatic" /><published>2024-03-24T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-03-24T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/do-not-dogmatic</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/do-not-dogmatic/"><![CDATA[<p>I am reading <a href="https://g.co/kgs/mVUfke">Build: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making Book</a> by Tony Fadell -</p>

<p>I wanted to call out Tony’s description on how to make a big change:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A company that’s likely to make a substantial change in the status quo has the following characteristics:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>It’s creating a product or service that’s wholly new or combines existing technology in a novel way that the competition can’t make or even understand.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>This product solves a problem—a real pain point-that a lot of customers experience daily. There should be an existing large market.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The novel technology can deliver on the company vision-not just within the product but also the infrastructure, platforms, and systems that support it.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><em>4. Leadership is not dogmatic about what the solution looks like and is willing to adapt to their customers’ needs</em>.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>It’s thinking about a problem or a customer need in a way you’ve never heard before, but which makes perfect sense once you hear it.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I especially like the fourth point about not being dogmatic. This point is crucial because it emphasizes the importance of being humble and adaptable in the face of real-world feedback. As the Mike Tyson famously once said, “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.” In my team I like to say: “Everyone has a Growth plan until they run their first live experiment.”</p>

<p>It’s easy to fall in love with our own product vision and believe that we know exactly what our users need. However, the reality is that our assumptions are often wrong or incomplete. Only by putting our products in front of real users and gathering feedback can we truly understand what works and what doesn’t.</p>

<p>Be humble. This doesn’t mean abandoning our vision altogether, but rather being open to tweaking and refining it based on real-world insights. The most successful products are those that strike a balance between a strong vision and a willingness to iterate based on user feedback. This requires a leadership team that is confident enough to set a direction, but humble enough to admit when they need to course-correct (and knowing when to do so quickly!)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I prefer live experiments over getting punched in the face]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to execute on growth</title><link href="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/how-to-execute-on-growth/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to execute on growth" /><published>2024-03-17T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-03-17T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/how-to-execute-on-growth</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/how-to-execute-on-growth/"><![CDATA[<p>As a big tech growth team lead, I’ve seen firsthand the impact that a growth mindset can have on an organization’s success. I have thought more than I care to admit about the key principles and strategies that can help unlock sustainable growth - here they are:</p>

<h1 id="small-g-and-big-g-growth-is-not-growth">small g and big G: growth is not Growth</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Pick which g/G refers to what, then stick with it.</li>
  <li>“growth” (small g) refers to the repeatable approach of optimizing the growth funnel: acquisition, churn resurrection, engagement, retention, and churn reduction.</li>
  <li>“Growth” (big G) acts on the core value proposition and requires product-market fit.</li>
  <li>It’s crucial for organizations to understand and prioritize both aspects, ensuring that “growth” efforts align with the overarching “Growth” strategy.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="hope-is-not-a-good-growth-strategy">Hope is not a (good) growth strategy</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Unfortunately just because it’s not a good strategy doesn’t stop people from using it</li>
  <li>Relying on hope alone is a common pitfall that many organizations fall into, often leading to disappointment and wasted resources.</li>
  <li>Successful growth requires a data-driven approach, clear goals, and a well-defined strategy backed by actionable plans and metrics.</li>
  <li>While hope can provide motivation, it should not be the foundation of a growth strategy.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="its-all-about-the-funnel-funnel-funnel">It’s all about the funnel funnel funnel</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The growth funnel is a fundamental concept that governs the success of any product or service.</li>
  <li>It’s math - it governs the world - please deal with it. I am not trying to throw shade at your product.</li>
  <li>Small changes that impact a large audience at the top of the funnel can often yield better results than big changes targeting a smaller slice of traffic.</li>
  <li>Organizations must prioritize and focus on the most critical stages of the funnel to maximize their growth efforts.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="growth-is-launch-and-iterate">growth is launch and iterate</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Ideal: 70% “core” / 30% opportunity</li>
  <li>The 70/30 rule emphasizes the importance of focusing primarily on the core mission (70%) while leaving room for opportunistic initiatives (30%).</li>
  <li>Launching quickly and iterating based on user feedback and data insights allows for faster learning and adaptation.</li>
  <li>Being agile and open to pivoting when necessary is crucial in today’s fast-paced market.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="theory-folks-dont-understand-how-to-think-about-growth-until-their-neck-is-on-the-line-for-growth">Theory: Folks don’t understand how to think about growth until their neck is on the line for growth</h1>
<ul>
  <li>People only truly grasp the importance of growth when they are directly accountable for it.</li>
  <li>It highlights the need for organizations to align incentives and create a culture where everyone feels responsible for growth.</li>
  <li>Encouraging a growth mindset across the organization can lead to more innovative ideas and collaborative efforts towards achieving growth targets.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="growth-portfolio-management">Growth Portfolio management</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Effective growth requires a balanced approach to resource allocation.</li>
  <li>Prioritize and fund proven growth levers before exploring unknown or experimental initiatives to ensure more predictable and reliable growth.</li>
  <li>Maintain a balance and allocate some resources to high-potential, innovative ideas that could become future growth drivers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Embracing a growth mindset is essential for success in the big tech industry and beyond. By understanding the difference between “growth” and “Growth,” leveraging the power of the funnel, and adopting a balanced approach to resource allocation, organizations can unlock sustainable growth and stay ahead of the curve. Remember, growth is not just about tactics; it’s a mindset that requires continuous learning, experimentation, and adaptation.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to execute on growth]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ethereum 2024 Thesis</title><link href="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/ethereum-thesis/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ethereum 2024 Thesis" /><published>2024-02-25T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-02-25T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/ethereum-thesis</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/ethereum-thesis/"><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum is my go-to crypto asset on the basis that it’s programmable money; just that it hasn’t found its iPhone moment. My thesis is that Gen AI and Ethereum provide that missing economic model for creators in the age of Gen AI.</p>

<p>Ethereum is the “silver” of the cryptocurrency world behind Bitcoin, which firmly anchors itself to Digital Gold and primarily as a store of value. While I have both cryptocurrencies in my portfolio, Ethereum is between the both of them, the stronger conviction investment for me. Here’s why.</p>

<h2 id="blockchains-are-not-databases-theyre-full-fledged-computers---chris-dixon-read-write-own">“Blockchains are not databases; they’re full-fledged computers.” - Chris Dixon, Read Write Own</h2>

<p>Forget the old notion of blockchains as static ledgers. Ethereum has shattered this perception by proving itself as a dynamic, programmable computer. This is a virtual computing platform that has ownership as a core design principle; “logging-in” doesn’t mean the same thing in Web3 as it does in Web2. This distinction is crucial; Ethereum provides a foundation for innovations that could reshape the internet as we know it.</p>

<p>The concept of “programmable money” is where I see the real game-changer. Ethereum allows for creating smart contracts, which are essentially programs that execute financial transactions under certain conditions. However, Ethereum hasn’t yet found its “iPhone moment” — that breakthrough application that makes its value obvious to everyone. We’ve seen sparks of interest with NFTs and DeFi, but these haven’t quite bridged the gap to mainstream adoption.</p>

<h2 id="most-current-ai-systems-have-no-economic-model-for-creators---chris-dixon-read-write-own">“Most current AI systems have no economic model for creators.” - Chris Dixon, Read Write Own</h2>

<p>The intersection of generative AI and Ethereum presents a compelling narrative. With Ethereum, there’s potential to create a new economic model for AI, where creators are compensated through smart contracts, and AI-generated content and services are traded on a decentralized marketplace. This could pave the way for fairer, more transparent economic systems for digital content and services. Moreover, as AI continues to evolve, integrating with Ethereum could ensure that the creators and developers behind AI innovations are directly rewarded for their contributions, fostering a more sustainable ecosystem for digital innovation.</p>

<p>I am cautiously optimistic, but the success of Ethereum feels like a matter of “when” rather than “if.” I’m betting it’s Gen AI-related.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gen AI + Ethereum]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Estimating the Probability of Not Proposing an Ethereum Block</title><link href="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/eth-validator-block-probability/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Estimating the Probability of Not Proposing an Ethereum Block" /><published>2024-01-27T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-27T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/eth-validator-block-probability</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/eth-validator-block-probability/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Plot</strong>: <a href="https://www.yewjin.com/assets/html/eth_block_probability.html">yewjin.com/assets/html/eth_block_probability.html</a> is a plot of the probabilities where you can fit in your own values.</p>

<p><strong>Note (June 2024)</strong>: This blog post is updated regularly (ideally daily!) with the current eligible ETH value from the blockchain.</p>

<p>As an Ethereum staker, one of the key aspects of participation in the network is decentralization … OK … nevermind it’s the opportunity to propose a block and hope for winning the block lottery. The probability of getting this chance, however, depends on several factors, most notably the total number of validators in the network and the number of validators you control. Here’s how to calculate the probability of not proposing a block over different time periods - an hour, a day, a week, or even a month. Because, admit it, you are only asking this question after not getting a block proposal for that long and you are asking: “WHAT ARE THE ODDS?!”</p>

<p>The Ethereum PoS protocol, specifically in the context of block validation, operates with discrete time units called slots. A new block is proposed in each slot by a randomly selected validator. The probability of a specific validator being chosen for any given slot is inversely proportional to the total number of effective ETH balance of each validator. See <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/block-proposal/">Block Proposal (ethereum.org)</a></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Total Eligible ETH (N):</strong> The total amount of eligible ETH in the network. As of 2024-09-06 10:15, it’s approximately 34261503 ETH.</li>
  <li><strong>Your ETH (V):</strong> The amount of ETH you have staked.</li>
  <li><strong>Time Period (T):</strong> The duration for which you want to calculate the probability, measured in slots. (Note: The Ethereum network typically operates with a slot time of 12 seconds.)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="calculating-the-probability">Calculating the Probability</h3>

<p>The probability of not proposing a block in a single slot, for a user with V ETH, is calculated as follows:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Probability (Single Slot) = 1 - (V / N)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To extend this to a specific time period, T slots, the formula becomes:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Probability (T Slots) = (1 - (V / N))^T
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Handy number of slots in various time periods</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>For One Hour:</strong> With T = 300 slots (assuming 12 seconds per slot).</li>
  <li><strong>For One Day:</strong> T = 7,200 slots.</li>
  <li><strong>For One Week:</strong> T = 50,400 slots.</li>
  <li><strong>For One Month:</strong> Approximating a month as 30 days, T = 216,000 slots.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="probabilities-for-32-eth">Probabilities for 32 ETH</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Probability of not proposing a block in one slot:</strong> \(1 - \frac{32}{34261503}\)</li>
  <li><strong>One Hour (300 slots):</strong> \(\left( 1 - \frac{32}{34261503} \right)^{300}\)</li>
  <li><strong>One Day (7,200 slots):</strong> \(\left( 1 - \frac{32}{34261503} \right)^{7200}\)</li>
  <li><strong>One Week (50,400 slots):</strong> \(\left( 1 - \frac{32}{34261503} \right)^{50400}\)</li>
  <li><strong>One Month (approx. 30 days, 216,000 slots):</strong> \(\left( 1 - \frac{32}{34261503} \right)^{216000}\)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Chance of not proposing a block in one hour:</strong> Approximately 99.97%</li>
  <li><strong>Chance of not proposing a block in one day:</strong> Approximately 99.33%</li>

<h1 id="calculating-the-probability-of-proposing-at-least-b-blocks">Calculating the Probability of Proposing At Least B Blocks</h1>

<p>To calculate the probability of proposing at least B blocks, we can use the Poisson distribution as an approximation for large T, where T is the total number of slots and p is the probability of proposing a block in a slot. The parameter lambda (λ) for the Poisson distribution is:</p>

\[\lambda = T \times \left( \frac{V}{N} \right)\]

<p>The cumulative probability of proposing at least B blocks is:</p>

\[P(\text{proposing at least } B \text{ blocks}) = 1 - \sum_{k=0}^{B-1} \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}\]

<p>where \(\lambda = T \times \left( \frac{V}{N} \right)\).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Probability of proposing at least 1 block in one day:</strong> \(1 - \sum_{k=0}^{0} \frac{\lambda_{1 \, day}^k e^{-\lambda_{1 \, day}}}{k!}\)</li>
  <li><strong>Probability of proposing at least 2 blocks in one week:</strong> \(1 - \sum_{k=0}^{1} \frac{\lambda_{1 \, week}^k e^{-\lambda_{1 \, week}}}{k!}\)</li>
  <li><strong>Probability of proposing at least 5 blocks in one month:</strong> \(1 - \sum_{k=0}^{4} \frac{\lambda_{1 \, month}^k e^{-\lambda_{1 \, month}}}{k!}\)</li>

<p>By leveraging AI technologies like OpenAI’s GPT-4 for content curation and summarization, and ElevenLabs’ text-to-speech for converting the script into a podcast, we can automate the process of creating personalized podcasts. It’s an exciting time to explore the possibilities of AI in customizing and enhancing our consumption of online content.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[One small step for how LLMs are going to change your world]]></summary></entry></feed>
