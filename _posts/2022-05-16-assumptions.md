description: Challenging assumptions about how the world works is challenging
---
In a recent workplace conversation to bring a Web3 proposal to execs and a concern was raised: “How can we get this web3 concept across to folks in a deck? It took me a long time immersing myself in this ecosystem before I understood why it’s different.”

It occurred to me that crypto and web3 challenge a lot of assumptions, and many of them might be silly and just plainly wrong. However, there are elements which might be game-changing. The opposition to these concepts though somehow just rub folks the wrong way, with folks scoffing and off-handedly dismissing explanations or evidence.

Here’s something that might set you off: Most people who criticize cryptocurrency can’t explain how money actually works. They intuitively just know that cryptocurrencies are *not* money and simply cannot be stores of value. If that’s you, try this exercise: explain what money is - why is it valuable? How does it work?

It’s also interesting to me how NFTs and Web3 trigger the crypto community in a similar way. See this interview summary with Vitalik Buterin by [benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/03/26212053/the-goal-of-crypto-is-not-to-play-games-with-million-dollar-pictures-of-monkeys-ethereum-f).

> Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was interviewed by TIME in a cover story, labeling him the “Prince of Crypto.”
> In the interview, Buterin said there are increasing dangers with cryptocurrencies, including overeager investors and soaring transaction fees.
> “Crypto itself has a lot of dystopian potential if implemented wrong,” Buterin said.
> The Ethereum co-founder went on to take an apparent shot at Bored Ape Yacht Club, an NFT collection that was minted on the Ethereum blockchain in April 2021.
> “The peril is you have these $3 million monkeys, and it becomes a different kind of gambling.”
> Buterin said a lot of people are buying yachts and lambos, but he hopes that in the future crypto is used for fair voting systems, urban planning and universal basic income.
> “If we don’t exercise our voice, the only things that get built are the things that are immediately profitable.”

It’s important
