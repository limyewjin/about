My name is Lim Yew Jin. I am currently a Software Engineer at Google in its Mountain View campus. I received a Bachelors of Mathematics Double Honors Degree in Pure Mathematics and Computer Science (With Distinction) from the University of Waterloo in June 2000. I then returned to Singapore and entered into national service in July 2000. Upon completion of full-time national service in Nov 2002 as a naval officer, I enrolled in the National University of Singapore in Jan 2003 after receiving the A*Star-NUS Graduate Fellowship. I obtained a PhD in Computer Science from the School of Computing, NUS, in September 2007. I joined Google in Nov 2007 and have worked in Search since then.
