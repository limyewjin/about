<p>Basically, no matter how you slice and dice your projects to optimize for Growth (capital G), the real growth (lowercase g) often lies in the seams between those projects and teams.</p>

<p>Picture this: a widget company has a deals team that busts their posteriors to secure awesome Black Friday discounts. They even get those deals featured on the homepage. Sounds great, right? All those users flooding the site will see the deals and go wild!</p>

<p>But wait, what about the email and notifications team? Shouldn’t they be crafting personalized updates and maybe even more exclusive deals for engaged users? And what about marketing? Are they on the same page with messaging, or will users get confused by mixed signals?</p>

<p>In big companies, this kind of coordination doesn’t happen automagically. Teams often optimize for their own little fiefdoms without seeing the bigger picture.</p>

<p>Now, decentralizing growth efforts is usually the secret to scaling. Trying to centralize everything just creates org friction and slows things down.</p>

<p>But there are times when it’s worth the extra elbow grease to get everyone singing from the same hymnal. My rule of thumb? When there’s a tidal wave of users expected, like during Black Friday or the World Cup, it’s time to yell (figuratively!) and get all hands on deck.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, growth is a team sport. By breaking down silos and looking at the big picture, you can find those hidden gems that really move the needle.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doing growth is like finding coins between the couch cushions]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">For growth’s sake, don’t be dogmatic</title><link href="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/do-not-dogmatic/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="For growth’s sake, don’t be dogmatic" /><published>2024-03-24T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-03-24T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/do-not-dogmatic</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/do-not-dogmatic/"><![CDATA[<p>I am reading <a href="https://g.co/kgs/mVUfke">Build: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making Book</a> by Tony Fadell -</p>

<p>I wanted to call out Tony’s description on how to make a big change:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A company that’s likely to make a substantial change in the status quo has the following characteristics:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>It’s creating a product or service that’s wholly new or combines existing technology in a novel way that the competition can’t make or even understand.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>This product solves a problem—a real pain point-that a lot of customers experience daily. There should be an existing large market.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The novel technology can deliver on the company vision-not just within the product but also the infrastructure, platforms, and systems that support it.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><em>4. Leadership is not dogmatic about what the solution looks like and is willing to adapt to their customers’ needs</em>.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>It’s thinking about a problem or a customer need in a way you’ve never heard before, but which makes perfect sense once you hear it.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I especially like the fourth point about not being dogmatic. This point is crucial because it emphasizes the importance of being humble and adaptable in the face of real-world feedback. As the Mike Tyson famously once said, “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.” In my team I like to say: “Everyone has a Growth plan until they run their first live experiment.”</p>

<p>It’s easy to fall in love with our own product vision and believe that we know exactly what our users need. However, the reality is that our assumptions are often wrong or incomplete. Only by putting our products in front of real users and gathering feedback can we truly understand what works and what doesn’t.</p>

<p>Be humble. This doesn’t mean abandoning our vision altogether, but rather being open to tweaking and refining it based on real-world insights. The most successful products are those that strike a balance between a strong vision and a willingness to iterate based on user feedback. This requires a leadership team that is confident enough to set a direction, but humble enough to admit when they need to course-correct (and knowing when to do so quickly!)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I prefer live experiments over getting punched in the face]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to execute on growth</title><link href="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/how-to-execute-on-growth/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to execute on growth" /><published>2024-03-17T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-03-17T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/how-to-execute-on-growth</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/how-to-execute-on-growth/"><![CDATA[<p>As a big tech growth team lead, I’ve seen firsthand the impact that a growth mindset can have on an organization’s success. I have thought more than I care to admit about the key principles and strategies that can help unlock sustainable growth - here they are:</p>

<h1 id="small-g-and-big-g-growth-is-not-growth">small g and big G: growth is not Growth</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Pick which g/G refers to what, then stick with it.</li>
  <li>“growth” (small g) refers to the repeatable approach of optimizing the growth funnel: acquisition, churn resurrection, engagement, retention, and churn reduction.</li>
  <li>“Growth” (big G) acts on the core value proposition and requires product-market fit.</li>
  <li>It’s crucial for organizations to understand and prioritize both aspects, ensuring that “growth” efforts align with the overarching “Growth” strategy.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="hope-is-not-a-good-growth-strategy">Hope is not a (good) growth strategy</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Unfortunately just because it’s not a good strategy doesn’t stop people from using it</li>
  <li>Relying on hope alone is a common pitfall that many organizations fall into, often leading to disappointment and wasted resources.</li>
  <li>Successful growth requires a data-driven approach, clear goals, and a well-defined strategy backed by actionable plans and metrics.</li>
  <li>While hope can provide motivation, it should not be the foundation of a growth strategy.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="its-all-about-the-funnel-funnel-funnel">It’s all about the funnel funnel funnel</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The growth funnel is a fundamental concept that governs the success of any product or service.</li>
  <li>It’s math - it governs the world - please deal with it. I am not trying to throw shade at your product.</li>
  <li>Small changes that impact a large audience at the top of the funnel can often yield better results than big changes targeting a smaller slice of traffic.</li>
  <li>Organizations must prioritize and focus on the most critical stages of the funnel to maximize their growth efforts.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="growth-is-launch-and-iterate">growth is launch and iterate</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Ideal: 70% “core” / 30% opportunity</li>
  <li>The 70/30 rule emphasizes the importance of focusing primarily on the core mission (70%) while leaving room for opportunistic initiatives (30%).</li>
  <li>Launching quickly and iterating based on user feedback and data insights allows for faster learning and adaptation.</li>
  <li>Being agile and open to pivoting when necessary is crucial in today’s fast-paced market.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="theory-folks-dont-understand-how-to-think-about-growth-until-their-neck-is-on-the-line-for-growth">Theory: Folks don’t understand how to think about growth until their neck is on the line for growth</h1>
<ul>
  <li>People only truly grasp the importance of growth when they are directly accountable for it.</li>
  <li>It highlights the need for organizations to align incentives and create a culture where everyone feels responsible for growth.</li>
  <li>Encouraging a growth mindset across the organization can lead to more innovative ideas and collaborative efforts towards achieving growth targets.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="growth-portfolio-management">Growth Portfolio management</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Effective growth requires a balanced approach to resource allocation.</li>
  <li>Prioritize and fund proven growth levers before exploring unknown or experimental initiatives to ensure more predictable and reliable growth.</li>
  <li>Maintain a balance and allocate some resources to high-potential, innovative ideas that could become future growth drivers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Embracing a growth mindset is essential for success in the big tech industry and beyond. By understanding the difference between “growth” and “Growth,” leveraging the power of the funnel, and adopting a balanced approach to resource allocation, organizations can unlock sustainable growth and stay ahead of the curve. Remember, growth is not just about tactics; it’s a mindset that requires continuous learning, experimentation, and adaptation.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to execute on growth]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ethereum 2024 Thesis</title><link href="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/ethereum-thesis/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ethereum 2024 Thesis" /><published>2024-02-25T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-02-25T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/ethereum-thesis</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/ethereum-thesis/"><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum is my go-to crypto asset on the basis that it’s programmable money; just that it hasn’t found its iPhone moment. My thesis is that Gen AI and Ethereum provide that missing economic model for creators in the age of Gen AI.</p>

<p>Ethereum is the “silver” of the cryptocurrency world behind Bitcoin, which firmly anchors itself to Digital Gold and primarily as a store of value. While I have both cryptocurrencies in my portfolio, Ethereum is between the both of them, the stronger conviction investment for me. Here’s why.</p>

<h2 id="blockchains-are-not-databases-theyre-full-fledged-computers---chris-dixon-read-write-own">“Blockchains are not databases; they’re full-fledged computers.” - Chris Dixon, Read Write Own</h2>

<p>Forget the old notion of blockchains as static ledgers. Ethereum has shattered this perception by proving itself as a dynamic, programmable computer. This is a virtual computing platform that has ownership as a core design principle; “logging-in” doesn’t mean the same thing in Web3 as it does in Web2. This distinction is crucial; Ethereum provides a foundation for innovations that could reshape the internet as we know it.</p>

<p>The concept of “programmable money” is where I see the real game-changer. Ethereum allows for creating smart contracts, which are essentially programs that execute financial transactions under certain conditions. However, Ethereum hasn’t yet found its “iPhone moment” — that breakthrough application that makes its value obvious to everyone. We’ve seen sparks of interest with NFTs and DeFi, but these haven’t quite bridged the gap to mainstream adoption.</p>

<h2 id="most-current-ai-systems-have-no-economic-model-for-creators---chris-dixon-read-write-own">“Most current AI systems have no economic model for creators.” - Chris Dixon, Read Write Own</h2>

<p>The intersection of generative AI and Ethereum presents a compelling narrative. With Ethereum, there’s potential to create a new economic model for AI, where creators are compensated through smart contracts, and AI-generated content and services are traded on a decentralized marketplace. This could pave the way for fairer, more transparent economic systems for digital content and services. Moreover, as AI continues to evolve, integrating with Ethereum could ensure that the creators and developers behind AI innovations are directly rewarded for their contributions, fostering a more sustainable ecosystem for digital innovation.</p>

<p>I am cautiously optimistic, but the success of Ethereum feels like a matter of “when” rather than “if.” I’m betting it’s Gen AI-related.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gen AI + Ethereum]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Estimating the Probability of Not Proposing an Ethereum Block</title><link href="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/eth-validator-block-probability/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Estimating the Probability of Not Proposing an Ethereum Block" /><published>2024-01-27T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-27T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/eth-validator-block-probability</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2024/eth-validator-block-probability/"><![CDATA[<p>As an Ethereum staker, one of the key aspects of participation in the network is decentralization … OK … nevermind it’s the opportunity to propose a block and hope for winning the block lottery. The probability of getting this chance, however, depends on several factors, most notably the total number of validators in the network and the number of validators you control. Here’s how to calculate the probability of not proposing a block over different time periods - an hour, a day, a week, or even a month. Because, admit it, you are only asking this question after not getting a block proposal for that long and you are asking: “WHAT ARE THE ODDS?!”</p>

<p>The Ethereum PoS protocol, specifically in the context of block validation, operates with discrete time units called slots. A new block is proposed in each slot by a randomly selected validator. The probability of a specific validator being chosen for any given slot is inversely proportional to the total number of validators.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Total Number of Validators (N):</strong> The entire set of validators staking ETH in the network. You can use <a href="https://www.validatorqueue.com/">validatorqueue.com</a> but as of Jan 27 2024, it’s around 905,000.</li>
  <li><strong>Your Validators (V):</strong> The number of validators under your control.</li>
  <li><strong>Time Period (T):</strong> The duration for which you want to calculate the probability, measured in slots. (Note: The Ethereum network typically operates with a slot time of 12 seconds.)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="calculating-the-probability">Calculating the Probability</h3>

<p>The probability of not proposing a block in a single slot, for a user with V validators, is calculated as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Probability (Single Slot) = 1 - (V / N)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To extend this to a specific time period, T slots, the formula becomes:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Probability (T Slots) = (1 - (V / N))^T
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Handy number of slots in various time periods</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>For One Hour:</strong> With T = 300 slots (assuming 12 seconds per slot).</li>
  <li><strong>For One Day:</strong> T = 7,200 slots.</li>
  <li><strong>For One Week:</strong> T = 50,400 slots.</li>
  <li><strong>For One Month:</strong> Approximating a month as 30 days, T = 216,000 slots.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="probabilities-for-1-validator">Probabilities for 1 Validator</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Probability of not proposing a block in one slot:</strong> \(1 - \frac{1}{905,000}\)</li>
  <li><strong>One Hour (300 slots):</strong> \(\left( 1 - \frac{1}{905,000} \right)^{300}\)</li>
  <li><strong>One Day (7,200 slots):</strong> \(\left( 1 - \frac{1}{905,000} \right)^{7200}\)</li>
  <li><strong>One Week (50,400 slots):</strong> \(\left( 1 - \frac{1}{905,000} \right)^{50400}\)</li>
  <li><strong>One Month (approx. 30 days, 216,000 slots):</strong> \(\left( 1 - \frac{1}{905,000} \right)^{216000}\)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Chance of not proposing a block in one hour:</strong> Approximately 99.97%</li>
  <li><strong>Chance of not proposing a block in one day:</strong> Approximately 99.21%</li>
  <li><strong>Chance of not proposing a block in one week:</strong> Approximately 94.58%</li>
  <li><strong>Chance of not proposing a block in one month:</strong> Approximately 78.75%</li>
  <li><strong>Chance of not proposing a block in 3 months:</strong> Approximately 48.84%</li>
  <li><strong>Chance of not proposing a block in 6 months:</strong> Approximately 23.86%</li>
  <li><strong>Chance of not proposing a block in 1 year:</strong> Approximately 5.69%</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="probabilities-for-100-validators">Probabilities for 100 Validators</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Probability of not proposing a block in one slot (for any of the 100 validators):</strong> \(1 - \frac{100}{905,000}\)</li>
  <li><strong>One Hour (300 slots):</strong> \(\left( 1 - \frac{100}{905,000} \right)^{300}\)</li>
  <li><strong>One Day (7,200 slots):</strong> \(\left( 1 - \frac{100}{905,000} \right)^{7200}\)</li>
  <li><strong>One Week (50,400 slots):</strong> \(\left( 1 - \frac{100}{905,000} \right)^{50400}\)</li>
  <li><strong>One Month (approx. 30 days, 216,000 slots):</strong> \(\left( 1 - \frac{100}{905,000} \right)^{216000}\)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="summary-1">Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Chance of not proposing a block in one hour:</strong> Approximately 96.74%</li>
  <li><strong>Chance of not proposing a block in one day:</strong> Approximately 45.10%</li>
  <li><strong>Chance of not proposing a block in one week:</strong> Approximately 0.38%</li>
  <li><strong>Chance of not proposing a block in one month:</strong> Practically 0% (very close to zero)</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s often said that the world changes more in the next 10 years than it has in the last 10 years. This rings especially true with the rapid development of technology like LLM (Large Language Models), Generative AI image/video generation, and blockchain. In the next three years, these technologies are likely to change the world more than it has in the past 10 years.</p>

<p>However, these technologies aren’t made equally. They often work together to create a larger impact on the world, with each technology reinforcing the positive effects of another. They also often have a negative side, making the effects of the other technologies worse.</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll discuss the potential impact of these technologies, as well as their potential shortcomings. We’ll focus on LLMs, generative AI image/video generation, and blockchain.</p>

<h2 id="llms-large-language-models">LLMs (Large Language Models)</h2>

<p>Steve Jobs famously said that the computer is a “bicycle for the mind”–a tool to make humans more efficient in writing. LLMs, or Large Language Models, are the acceleration of the bicycle for the mind. LLMs allow humans to write more quickly and eloquently than ever before by relying on AI assistance.</p>

<p>The best writing won’t be entirely written by AI, however. It’ll be a collaboration between human and AI, with humans relying on AI to help them write better and faster. But this collaboration has its drawbacks, like the potential for cheating, and more effective misinformation.</p>

<h3 id="potential-for-cheating">Potential for Cheating</h3>

<p>Cheating will be easier than ever before with LLMs. Students will be able to rely on LLMs to help them quickly write essays for their homework or school assignments. Similarly, students may be able to use LLMs to help them write exams and homework.</p>

<p>What happens when LLMs become too effective at writing? It’ll be harder to find the best writers, and it’ll be harder to distinguish between good and bad writers. LLMs that can write will also make it easier to write quality text quickly, making it harder to detect cheating even when a student uses an LLM to help them write.</p>

<h3 id="more-effective-misinformation">More Effective Misinformation</h3>

<p>Misinformation is information that’s false, but usually presented in a manner that appears true to the uninformed reader. Those who are misinformed are often aware that the information is false, but deliberately present it as if it’s true. This can cause people to believe the information and act on it, even if it’s wrong.</p>

<p>For example, a politician may want to spread false information about their opponent to convince people that their opponent is dishonest. In this scenario, it’s likely that the politician is aware that the information is false, but will spread it anyway because it benefits them.</p>

<p>Misinformation has always been a problem. Misinformation has never been more effective or easy to create than it is now, with the help of writing AI.</p>

<p>For example, a politician may use writing AI to write text that they can use to mislead the public. This text will be written in a way that sounds accurate and believable to the reader, making it harder to disprove or refute.</p>

<h2 id="generative-ai-art">Generative AI Art</h2>

<p>Generative AI image generation is advancing rapidly, and generative AI video generation is inevitable. With these technologies, we will have higher quality images and videos, as well as more efficient ways to create content. Still, many people will rely on AI to create content, and this is where AI’s relentless ability to scale and produce a large amount of information will overwhelm our current systems. For example, AI models are currently being used to create art that’s similar to a specific artist’s style, or an individual person’s style.</p>

<p>This may sound like fiction, but it’s actually happening now. Tools like DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, etc. showed that AI models are able to create images that are similar to an individual artist’s style, or an individual person’s style. These models can also create art that’s similar to a specific artist’s style, or an individual person’s style.</p>

<h2 id="what-systems-are-being-overwhelmed">What Systems are Being Overwhelmed?</h2>

<p>Still, many people will rely on AI to create content, and this is where AI’s relentless ability to scale and produce a large amount of information will overwhelm our current systems.</p>

<p>The cultural and economic systems are likely to be particularly affected. The debate around AI art stealing from existing artists is analogous to human artists being inspired by works of art that they see and learn from. This raises the question of whether this type of “standing on the shoulders of giants” works when AI does it.</p>

<p>The current digital copyright systems are also likely to be overwhelmed. Digital media can easily be copied and redistributed, making it more difficult to control the spread of digital media. This can lead to the devaluation of original artwork and the potential for more legal disputes over the ownership of digital media.</p>

<h3 id="the-increasing-need-for-scalable-digital-ownership">The Increasing Need for Scalable Digital Ownership</h3>

<p>As LLMs and generative AI become more advanced, the need for scalable digital ownership will become increasingly critical. Blockchain technology, via Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), provides a viable solution, as it allows digital content to be securely tracked and buy and sold. This would help protect original creators from losing out on potential profits from their artwork, and would also reduce the amount of legal disputes over the ownership of digital media.</p>

<p>NFTs provides a way to prove ownership and authorship of digital content, allowing creators to monetize their work. This can also help reduce the potential for cheating and misinformation, as the provenance of content can be verified. Additionally, this could help reduce the amount of digital theft since digital media can be tracked and traced to its original owner. Finally, it could also lead to new economic models, as digital content can be securely bought, sold, and traded with ease.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the next three years, the world is likely to change more than it has in the past 10 years due to the rapid development of LLMs, generative AI, and blockchain. LLMs allow humans to write more quickly and eloquently, while generative AI image and video generation is likely to improve the quality of digital media. Blockchains and NFTs will help reduce digital theft and create a secure way of proving digital ownership. All of these technologies are likely to overwhelm our current systems, leading to a cultural and economic revolution where these technologies work together to create a new ecosystem to support the industry.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[LLM, Generative AI Art, and Blockchain are going to change the world]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Learning as a Web3 creator</title><link href="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2022/web3-creator/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Learning as a Web3 creator" /><published>2022-12-18T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-12-18T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2022/web3-creator</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2022/web3-creator/"><![CDATA[<p>I have been looking for ways to learn more about Web3 and content creating.
