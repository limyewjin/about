And You! And You!</h1>

<p>Imagine starting your day with a tailored podcast, containing summarized stories from various newspapers and websites that you care about. With advances in LLMs and Text-to-Speech, it is now possible to automate this process. Let’s explore how to leverage AI to curate, summarize, and transform online stories into personalized podcasts.</p>

<p>To start, here’s a sample podcast created on July 29, 2023.</p>

<h2 id="curating-online-stories">Curating Online Stories</h2>

<p>Our journey begins with curating the stories. We navigate to the URL of the website we’re interested in and fetch the text content for processing.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">url</span>
<span class="n">html</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">navigate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">formatted_text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">textapi</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">scrape_text</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">html</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="extracting-and-selecting-topics">Extracting and Selecting Topics</h2>
<p>Once we have the formatted text, we can extract main topics and stories using LLMs - the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates">OpenAI Function Calling update</a> was particularly useful. This is done iteratively until we have a satisfactory selection of topics.</p>

<h2 id="summarizing-stories-and-discussions">Summarizing Stories and Discussions</h2>
<p>Next we can summarize the main stories and discussions using … LLMs. :-)</p>

<h2 id="compiling-the-podcast-script">Compiling the Podcast Script</h2>
<p>With the summaries of the stories and discussions, we can now compile our podcast script using LLMs. The entire podcast is then put together with all the information gathered so far with a “producer” LLM step.</p>

<h2 id="converting-the-script-into-a-podcast">Converting the Script into a Podcast</h2>
<p>Finally, we convert the podcast script into an actual podcast. We first generate the audio for each text segment using <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/speech-synthesis">ElevenLabs’ speech synthesis</a>.</p>

<p>And voila! You now have your personalized podcast, ready to play, with stories and discussions from your favorite online sources.</p>

<p>By leveraging AI technologies like OpenAI’s GPT-4 for content curation and summarization, and ElevenLabs’ text-to-speech for converting the script into a podcast, we can automate the process of creating personalized podcasts. It’s an exciting time to explore the possibilities of AI in customizing and enhancing our consumption of online content.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[One small step for how LLMs are going to change your world]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How LLM, Generative AI Image/Video, and Blockchain will Change the World in the Next 3 Years</title><link href="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2023/llm/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How LLM, Generative AI Image/Video, and Blockchain will Change the World in the Next 3 Years" /><published>2023-01-16T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-16T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2023/llm</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2023/llm/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="how-llm-generative-ai-and-blockchain-are-going-to-change-the-world-in-the-next-3-years">How LLM, Generative AI, and Blockchain are Going to Change the World in the Next 3 Years</h1>

<p>It’s often said that the world changes more in the next 10 years than it has in the last 10 years. This rings especially true with the rapid development of technology like LLM (Large Language Models), Generative AI image/video generation, and blockchain. In the next three years, these technologies are likely to change the world more than it has in the past 10 years.</p>

<p>However, these technologies aren’t made equally. They often work together to create a larger impact on the world, with each technology reinforcing the positive effects of another. They also often have a negative side, making the effects of the other technologies worse.</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll discuss the potential impact of these technologies, as well as their potential shortcomings. We’ll focus on LLMs, generative AI image/video generation, and blockchain.</p>

<h2 id="llms-large-language-models">LLMs (Large Language Models)</h2>

<p>Steve Jobs famously said that the computer is a “bicycle for the mind”–a tool to make humans more efficient in writing. LLMs, or Large Language Models, are the acceleration of the bicycle for the mind. LLMs allow humans to write more quickly and eloquently than ever before by relying on AI assistance.</p>

<p>The best writing won’t be entirely written by AI, however. It’ll be a collaboration between human and AI, with humans relying on AI to help them write better and faster. But this collaboration has its drawbacks, like the potential for cheating, and more effective misinformation.</p>

<h3 id="potential-for-cheating">Potential for Cheating</h3>

<p>Cheating will be easier than ever before with LLMs. Students will be able to rely on LLMs to help them quickly write essays for their homework or school assignments. Similarly, students may be able to use LLMs to help them write exams and homework.</p>

<p>What happens when LLMs become too effective at writing? It’ll be harder to find the best writers, and it’ll be harder to distinguish between good and bad writers. LLMs that can write will also make it easier to write quality text quickly, making it harder to detect cheating even when a student uses an LLM to help them write.</p>

<h3 id="more-effective-misinformation">More Effective Misinformation</h3>

<p>Misinformation is information that’s false, but usually presented in a manner that appears true to the uninformed reader. Those who are misinformed are often aware that the information is false, but deliberately present it as if it’s true. This can cause people to believe the information and act on it, even if it’s wrong.</p>

<p>For example, a politician may want to spread false information about their opponent to convince people that their opponent is dishonest. In this scenario, it’s likely that the politician is aware that the information is false, but will spread it anyway because it benefits them.</p>

<p>Misinformation has always been a problem. Misinformation has never been more effective or easy to create than it is now, with the help of writing AI.</p>

<p>For example, a politician may use writing AI to write text that they can use to mislead the public. This text will be written in a way that sounds accurate and believable to the reader, making it harder to disprove or refute.</p>

<h2 id="generative-ai-art">Generative AI Art</h2>

<p>Generative AI image generation is advancing rapidly, and generative AI video generation is inevitable. With these technologies, we will have higher quality images and videos, as well as more efficient ways to create content. Still, many people will rely on AI to create content, and this is where AI’s relentless ability to scale and produce a large amount of information will overwhelm our current systems. For example, AI models are currently being used to create art that’s similar to a specific artist’s style, or an individual person’s style.</p>

<p>This may sound like fiction, but it’s actually happening now. Tools like DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, etc. showed that AI models are able to create images that are similar to an individual artist’s style, or an individual person’s style. These models can also create art that’s similar to a specific artist’s style, or an individual person’s style.</p>

<h2 id="what-systems-are-being-overwhelmed">What Systems are Being Overwhelmed?</h2>

<p>Still, many people will rely on AI to create content, and this is where AI’s relentless ability to scale and produce a large amount of information will overwhelm our current systems.</p>

<p>The cultural and economic systems are likely to be particularly affected. The debate around AI art stealing from existing artists is analogous to human artists being inspired by works of art that they see and learn from. This raises the question of whether this type of “standing on the shoulders of giants” works when AI does it.</p>

<p>The current digital copyright systems are also likely to be overwhelmed. Digital media can easily be copied and redistributed, making it more difficult to control the spread of digital media. This can lead to the devaluation of original artwork and the potential for more legal disputes over the ownership of digital media.</p>

<h3 id="the-increasing-need-for-scalable-digital-ownership">The Increasing Need for Scalable Digital Ownership</h3>

<p>As LLMs and generative AI become more advanced, the need for scalable digital ownership will become increasingly critical. Blockchain technology, via Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), provides a viable solution, as it allows digital content to be securely tracked and buy and sold. This would help protect original creators from losing out on potential profits from their artwork, and would also reduce the amount of legal disputes over the ownership of digital media.</p>

<p>NFTs provides a way to prove ownership and authorship of digital content, allowing creators to monetize their work. This can also help reduce the potential for cheating and misinformation, as the provenance of content can be verified. Additionally, this could help reduce the amount of digital theft since digital media can be tracked and traced to its original owner. Finally, it could also lead to new economic models, as digital content can be securely bought, sold, and traded with ease.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the next three years, the world is likely to change more than it has in the past 10 years due to the rapid development of LLMs, generative AI, and blockchain. LLMs allow humans to write more quickly and eloquently, while generative AI image and video generation is likely to improve the quality of digital media. Blockchains and NFTs will help reduce digital theft and create a secure way of proving digital ownership. All of these technologies are likely to overwhelm our current systems, leading to a cultural and economic revolution where these technologies work together to create a new ecosystem to support the industry.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[LLM, Generative AI Art, and Blockchain are going to change the world]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Learning as a Web3 creator</title><link href="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2022/web3-creator/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Learning as a Web3 creator" /><published>2022-12-18T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-12-18T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2022/web3-creator</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2022/web3-creator/"><![CDATA[<p>I have been looking for ways to learn more about Web3 and content creating.

<p>Use <a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/">Gnosis Safe</a> to manage a multi-sig wallet secured by multiple hardware wallets like those from <a href="https://www.ledger.com/">Ledger</a>, <a href="https://gridplus.io/products/grid-lattice1">Grid+ Lattice1</a>, and <a href="https://trezor.io/">Trezor</a>.</p>

<p>Next, secure your hardware wallets with the following protocol:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use steel plates/capsules to protect from physical events and degradation over time.</li>
  <li>Utilize <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki#from-mnemonic-to-seed">BIP39 passphrase</a> to require a password on top of the seed phrase.</li>
  <li>Shamir’s secret sharing to shard seed phrases to store steel plates/capsules in multiple locations, and prevents any single discovery to be an issue like <a href="https://github.com/iancoleman/shamir39">Shamir39</a></li>
</ol>

<p>i.e., multisig wallet with the hardware wallets access to multiple factors with password/pins, and recovery of hardware wallets in case of hardware failure requires knowledge (BIP39 passphrase) on top of just physically recovering multiple seeds. The hardware wallets are somewhat optional but it can be a security risk itself to try and recover your private keys often.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Writing this down because the other liability is forgetting the protocol]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)–The NAD+ Precursor That May Help Combat Aging and Disease</title><link href="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2022/nmn/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)–The NAD+ Precursor That May Help Combat Aging and Disease" /><published>2022-07-18T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-07-18T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2022/nmn</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2022/nmn/"><![CDATA[<p>As we age, our cells gradually become less efficient at converting food into energy. This process, known as cellular senescence, is a major contributor to the aging process. But what if there were a way to help cells stay young and healthy for longer?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.foundmyfitness.com/topics/nicotinamide-mononucleotide">Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)</a> is a compound that has shown promise in treating aging and age-related diseases. NMN is an intermediate compound in the NAD+ salvage pathway, the recycling of nicotinamide into NAD+. NAD+ levels decrease with age and may in part drive the aging process and the development of age-related diseases. Boosting NAD+ levels through precursors has proven to have therapeutic potential in treating aging and age-related diseases across multiple animal models. NMN supplements are readily available, and studies in animal models have shown that NMN can help reverse age-related cellular decline and improve cognitive function.</p>

<p>In a study involving diet-induced diabetic mice, injection of 500 milligrams per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg/bw) of nicotinamide mononucleotide administered for seven days enhanced insulin sensitivity and improved glucose intolerance compared to that observed among mice not given nicotinamide mononucleotide. Additionally, the mice that were fed nicotinamide mononucleotide had improved skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, increased energy expenditure, increased bone density, and decreased insulin resistance in a dose-dependent manner.</p>

<p>Rats that were injected with 500 mg/kg/bw of nicotinamide mononucleotide every day for 10 days demonstrated sustained improvement in cognitive function as well as an attenuation of neuronal cell death. These data suggest that nicotinamide mononucleotide has potential as a therapy for aging and age-related diseases. However, the safety and efficacy of NMN supplementation in humans remain unknown.</p>

<p>The first human clinical trial of NMN is now underway, and early results are promising. If NMN is found to be safe and effective in humans, it could be a major breakthrough in the fight against aging and age-related diseases.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A promising compound for aging and age-related diseases]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Weekend Warriors Get the Same Benefits as Those Who Spread Their Activity Out Across the Week</title><link href="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2022/exercise/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Weekend Warriors Get the Same Benefits as Those Who Spread Their Activity Out Across the Week" /><published>2022-07-05T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-07-05T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2022/exercise</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.yewjin.com/blog/2022/exercise/"><![CDATA[<p>It’s no secret that exercise is important for our overall health and well-being. But with our busy lives, it can be hard to find the time to fit it in. That’s why it’s great to know that a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-62040665">new study</a> has found that we can get the same health benefits from exercising in short, intense bursts on the weekend as we can from spreading our activity out across the week.</p>

<p>So if you’re looking to improve your health and reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke, the findings suggest that it doesn’t matter when you exercise, as long as you’re getting at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity each week.</p>

<p>The study, which was published in the JAMA Internal Medicine journal, tracked 350,000 US adults over 10 years and found that those who reached the recommended level of activity had lower mortality rates, regardless of whether they exercised during the week or on the weekend.</p>

<p>So if you’re short on time, a big burst of exercise on the weekend may be just as effective as spreading your activity out throughout the week. And if you’re looking for ideas on how to get your 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity, the NHS recommends brisk walking, light cycling, or doubles tennis as some options.</p>

A new study from the University of Wisconsin–Madison has found no evidence of structural brain changes with short-term mindfulness training.</p>

<p>Chalking this under “Probably not unexpected” section, but unlike studies where long-term mindfulness meditation did have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4712309/">effects on Brain’s White Matter Microstructure</a>, it looks like there is no significant difference in brain structure for short-term mindfulness practice.</p>

<p>The study, led by Richard Davidson, compared brain scans of people who completed an eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) course with those of a control group who did not receive any mindfulness training. The researchers found no significant differences in brain structure between the two groups.</p>

<p>While it is still early in the research on the effects of meditation on the brain, this study provides some evidence that mindfulness meditation may not be as effective as previously thought in terms of changing brain structure.</p>

Whether you are a dad yourself, or you have a father figure in your life that you look up to, this day is for celebrating all the great things that fathers do. From being a protector and provider, to being a shoulder to cry on and a sounding board for life’s toughest decisions, fathers play an incredibly important role in our lives. So on this Father’s Day, take a moment to appreciate all the wonderful fathers out there, and let them know just how much you care.</p>

<p>For me, Father’s Day is a time to reflect on my own father and all that he has done for me. He has always been my biggest supporter, whether I was taking on a new challenge or just needed someone to talk to. He has always been there for me, and I am so grateful for that. I know that I am luckier than many people, because my father is still alive and we have a great relationship. But even if your father is no longer with you, I think it is still important to take a moment to remember all the good times and the lessons he taught you.</p>

<p>So on this Father’s Day, take a moment to appreciate all the fathers out there, whether they are still with us or not. They play an incredibly important role in our lives and we are so lucky to have them.</p>

<p>Sure, there are management books which espouse theory, but let’s be honest — they make it sound more complicated than it needs to be, and I read them, but I just didn’t grok them. Take this this gem about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_setting#In_business">goal setting in business</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In business, goal setting encourages participants to put in substantial effort. Also, because every member has defined expectations for their role, little room is left for inadequate, marginal effort to go unnoticed.</p>

  <p>Managers cannot constantly drive motivation, or keep track of an employee’s work on a continuous basis. Goals are therefore an important tool for managers, since goals have the ability to function as a self-regulatory mechanism that helps employees prioritize tasks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This doesn’t help me though: I need a playbook with specifics on how to structure and delegate effectively for software engineering projects that somehow relate back to the theory. How exactly do you go about this?</p>

<p>Here’s my take: <em>visioneering</em>.</p>

<h1 id="visioneering">Visioneering</h1>
<p>I loosely define visioneering as the series of actions to take to build up a shared vision and long term goals for the team. At its core, visioneering consists of three parts:</p>

<p>1 Defining a desirable and attainable goal
  2 Communicating and getting consensus on the goal
  3 Empowering teammates to achieve that goal</p>

<h2 id="1-defining-a-desirable-and-attainable-goal">1. Defining a desirable and attainable goal</h2>
<p>Setting challenging yet attainable goals with high impact. As a line manager, the goal given might be quite specific — “Get accuracy to at least 90%” or “Build a deployable system that does X, Y, and Z”. But even with such specifics there is often still large components to design and implement.</p>

<p>As a director where you are given larger areas of focus, your goal is to set the direction of the project and team — “We will build a better ranking system by first scaling our data collection pipeline and building a robust evaluation metrics”.</p>

<p>You should spend enough time to have a coherent topline goal, and to move onto the next step of communicating the goal, perhaps with the more senior members of the team at first, and to come back to refining your goal as you get more inputs and insights from others.</p>

<h2 id="2-communicating-and-getting-consensus-on-the-goal">2. Communicating and getting consensus on the goal</h2>
<p>A good rule of thumb as a manager is that you can’t never over-communicate. Even if you think you are repeating the same goal too many times, you would be surprised at how teammates appreciate being engaged in discussions about goals multiple times as they develop different perspectives over time. This is particularly true for big pivots in directions.</p>

<p>In my experience, as the scope of the goal becomes more abstract, more of the effort should be spent discussing on why the goal is important. This is because with specificity engineers tend to gravitate towards problem-solving immediately, as opposed to more abstract goals which invite questions. (*)</p>

<p>(*) Correlation is not causation of course, and another plausible explanation is that having larger scope problems correlates with higher level thinking and working with more senior engineers who tend to be better at questioning the whys of projects.</p>

<p>There are three specific ways I like to communicate goals: A) one-pagers, B) presentations, and C) in-person discussions.</p>

<p>A) One-pagers: Write down your ideas and goals in prose concisely. This helps both the recipient (short and sweet summary), and yourself (collect your thoughts).</p>

<p>B) Presentations: Communicates your thoughts effectively in a group setting, also good to have presentations which are easily shared with partners and leadership to convey expectations. (Let’s be honest, the pointy-heads aren’t going to read your one-pagers)</p>

<p>C) In-person discussions: Nothing beats face-to-face discussions to solicit honest and useful feedback.</p>

<h2 id="3-empowering-teammates-to-achieve-that-goal">3. Empowering teammates to achieve that goal</h2>
<p>If the scope of the project is small enough, implementation can start immediately, but once the project grows to an effort requiring a team over multiple weeks or months, this is where I would have called “delegation” previously would start as an external observer.</p>

<p>Here’s my heuristic: you ask your team (or specific individuals) to write down how they are going to achieve the end goal (e.g., a design doc). And in fact if the project is still large enough, it could even be another visioneering task for them.</p>

<p>Why do this? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_setting#Employee_motivation">Goal-commitment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Goal-commitment, the most influential moderator, becomes especially important when dealing with difficult or complex goals. If people lack commitment to goals, they lack motivation to reach them. To commit to a goal, one must believe in its importance or significance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By writing down in a document the ideas and steps, the team member feels more ownership of the process, and there should be processes in the organization that allow the design document to be shared internally so that it gets reviewed by others. This also empowers the teammate to get agreement on the next steps and allows for more effective implementation.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visioneering is such a great word]]></summary></entry></feed>
