In a lot of cases, they're actually right, but the fact that they're right is actually totally beside the point because what they're not understanding is the potential. They're not understanding what this is going to turn into and they're, in particular, not going to understand what happens when like a lot of the world's smartest people devote themselves to solving all these problems and that's how you get... that's how you ultimately get these amazing outcomes out the other side."
