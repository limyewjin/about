description: #cryptocrash trending on Twitter as I write this
---
(This is going to be an ongoing blog post that I will add to over the next few days)

As I am writing this blog post \#cryptocrash is tredning on Twitter. ETH is at $1300 and BTC is at $18,800. This isn't looking good to say the least, but I figure I will write down my thesis as a matter of financial discipline.

  * ETH. Long-term bullish. Short-term confused.
  * BTC. Store of value.
  * APE. Yuga Labs ecosystem.
  * NFTs
    * Yuga Labs: BAYC, Punks, Otherside, MAYC, BAKC. In that order.
    * Moonbirds
    * Nouns?
